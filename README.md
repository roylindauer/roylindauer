### ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Roy.

I'm a software engineer and technical leader.

I build reliable, maintainable systems and help teams do the same.

Over the last 20+ years, I've worked across Rails, WordPress, PHP/Laravel, and DevOps where I solved problems in different stacks, teams, and industries. My focus is always the same: clarity, performance, and maintainability.

Today, I'm an Associate Technical Director at [Noble Studios](https://www.noblestudios.com), where I guide engineering teams and improve how we build and deliver high impact web sites and applications. Before that, I was a Senior DevOps Engineer at Herbl/Blackbird Logistics.

Outside of work, I'm an artist, a lifelong learner, Linux enthusiast, and avid reader. I'm also a husband, a puppy dad, and someone who finds real joy in both writing clean code and exploring creative arts. For me, creativity and engineering have always been connected.
