### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Roy Lindauer.

I am a software engineer aspiring to create world-class software. With a diverse skill set spanning docker-based SDLC automation, Systems Engineering, DevOps, Full-Stack Software Engineering, and Web Design, I bring a unique blend of technical expertise and creative flair to every project. I thrive on blending technical expertise with creative ingenuity to deliver exceptional outcomes in every project I undertake. 

Throughout my career, I've been driven by the belief that everyone, from users to SaaS operators, deserves a stellar web experience. My mission has been to empower businesses and organizations in achieving this goal by architecting reliable, maintainable, and secure websites, web applications, and the infrastructure underpinning them. I excel when given the opportunity to refine code bases and enhance projects to their fullest potential. I've achieved success by spearheading the definition and implementation of processes within teams, leveraging my years of experience and willingness to assist others. Additionally, I actively learn from my colleagues, constantly seeking opportunities to elevate both myself and those around me.

I am currently working on building a client portal built with Ruby on Rails to support my wife's business. Recently, I played a pivotal role in enabling a startup to scale and enhance its mobile application by revamping its backend infrastructure into a robust, docker-based cloud setup. I spearheaded the implementation of continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines, fostering a DevOps mindset within the team. Additionally, I've been instrumental in enhancing their Ruby on Rails codebase, tackling performance issues, and introducing new features. Additionally, I've provided invaluable support to startups through technical project management, marketing initiatives, and NextJS support.

Beyond my professional endeavors, I'm an avid reader and learner, a traveler, and a connoisseur of delicious cuisine alongside my wife. We have a wonderful little corgi Olive. I am also an aspiring photographer and artist. I have a deep passion for electronic music, and spent several years as an after-hours DJ, was co-host of an underground radio station, and was an early podcast adopter with a project called Lunchbox Radio.
